These are my programs for 
- advent of code
- cyberstart: headquarters and moon base. (denoted by L_ C_ or Level _ Challenge _)
- ranges.io, limited time event by magnetic rock

The code I wrote is definitely not the most efficient it could be, so I'll probably update them in the future. They all work to give the desired output though.
